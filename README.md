Tricky XML Parsing Algorithm
============================

1) for each of the parent , find the last child node.

2) store each of the child node values in a file

3) in the example the last child nodes are 

* eleven
* fifteen
* three
* four
* eight
 
 
The file will have values like

* eleven
* fifteen
* three
* four
* eight

 
4) if place contains more than one name node at any point, get the first name node of that place, instead of last ,  get first
